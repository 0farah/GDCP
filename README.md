## Project Overview

The project aims to revolutionize the landscape of clinical studies by integrating the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) into the healthcare domain. Clinical studies play a pivotal role in advancing medical research and patient care, necessitating the secure handling and controlled sharing of sensitive patient data. Recognizing this challenge, our project seeks to empower patients with control over their personal information while ensuring privacy, ethical compliance, and seamless data exchange.

### Goals and Objectives

The primary goal of the project is to develop a secure and user-centric workflow that allows patients to manage their personal data in clinical studies. This involves the implementation of a decentralized and trust-based ecosystem, where patients can securely share their data with clinical investigators and medical centers while maintaining ownership and control.

### Key Components

1. Secure Connection Establishment: The project involves the creation of a secure connection between patients and Clinical Investigators (CIs) through QR code authentication, ensuring encrypted and authenticated communication.

2. User-Controlled Consent: Patients will have the autonomy to provide or revoke their consent for participating in clinical studies, reflecting the Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) concept of data control.

3. Data Exchange and Medical Center Authorization: The project will facilitate the secure exchange of study documents between patients and CIs, ensuring patient privacy. Furthermore, the system will enable CIs to present justifications to medical centers for accessing patient data in a compliant and ethical manner.

4. Integration of SSI Principles: Our solution will implement the principles of Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI), allowing patients to authenticate and control their personal information across the clinical study lifecycle.

### Expected Impact

By seamlessly integrating SSI principles into clinical studies, this project will enhance patient data security, foster trust between patients and healthcare stakeholders, and accelerate medical research through more ethical and privacy-conscious data sharing. The project's outcome aligns with the broader objective of advancing healthcare while respecting individual data sovereignty.

## Application Setup 

In order to get the application working on patient devices please click [here](https://github.com/0farah/GDCP/blob/main/application/README.md).

## Runing The Agents

We developed an agent for each individual entity that needs to be executed before utilizing the portals.
To do so, please click [here](https://github.com/0farah/GDCP/blob/main/agents/README.md).

## Runing Portals

For each entity, we meticulously designed and developed a user-friendly portal that ensures ease of use and accessibility. These purpose-built portals serve as the interface through which our project operates. Moreover, each portal seamlessly integrates with the APIs of its corresponding agent, allowing for efficient communication and interaction within the system.
To access and utilize the portals developed for each entity, please follow this [link](https://github.com/0farah/GDCP/blob/main/portals/README.md).
